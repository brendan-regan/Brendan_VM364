#Dawn of a New Age and our Role in Defining it - Dispatch Technologies


##When I arrived
I met Derek in the elevator. He had never been to a meet up before either, but worked in the office that hosted it and decided to join. When I entered the room, there were about 6 people in there, all talking very softly. One man brought a VR Kix - a smartphone operated VR Headset

We all introduced ourselves and I found quickly that everyone in the room came from very different backgrounds. Many were experienced with unity and game design, while others were videographers and designers. Some people, such as one man named Paul, were head honchos at companies looking for possible investment opportunities. One interesting thing the designer mentioned was just how freeing the VR world is. There are no design guidlines when it comes to VR, so it's a huge opportunity for growth. 

Dispatch, the company who was hosting the event, builds software for mobile and desktop applications which organize workers and delivery men to make their time more efficient and their lives a little easier. I found this pretty cool. 

According to Craig, who led the meetup and gave us the presentation, VR's main drawback is it's tendancy to invoke motion sickness, which isn't a reason to write it off entirely - Craig insisted that VR wasn't causing the motion sickness, but that particular experience in VR is causing the motion sickness. To Craig, who was skeptical for a long time, VR has finally reached a very interesting point - it's going into the hands of the consumers. 

The industry is expected to grow exponentially starting in 2017, when the first headsets will be commercially available. With this, production will finally meet demand, and the trend shows that this industry will be worth upwards of 23 billion dollars by 2019, which certainly piqued Paul's interest.

Perception Neuron - lots of wires and connections - super realistic body motion capture.

Unlimited Hand - Touch simulator - same feeling of touch each time - no simulation of texture, but very immersive. Uses electrical muscle stimulation. Legal in Japan.

###Managing Expectations

A VR user has a certain amount of expectations when they enter a game. They expect it to look good, sound good, account for proprioception, and allow for multiple sense input. 

Craig says that it is the designers responsibility to manage those expectations, and ease the user into the space, while also maintaining interest. Designers must anticipate what user will do and make adjustments accordingly, much like the iterative process of game design. 

##Other Uses of VR

Craig mentioned many potential uses of VR. Tours of businesses or buildings for architects or contractors, exposure therapy, car test drives, STRIVR - Sport simulator, or potentially treating ocular disorders - Luminopia is a company spear-heading this.

##Takeaways
I found this a very informative experience. I was able to talk and listen to many different perpectives on VR and game design. They mentioned other meetups with different groups and also encouraged us all to come to more meetups. As this was the first meeting of this particular group, it was a little disjointed and there was a certain level of discomfort in the room, but I'm sure that that will fade with subsequent meetings once people begin to get to know each other. There were about 15 people there, which I found the perfect number. This led to a far more intmate discussion and exploration of the subject. I found it extremely interesting that this budding technology was attracting people from otherwise very different concentrations.
