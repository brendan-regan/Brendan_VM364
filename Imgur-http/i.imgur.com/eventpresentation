#Dawn of a New Age and our Role in Defining it - Dispatch Technologies


###When I arrived
I met Derek in the elevator. He had never been to a meet up before either, but worked in the office that hosted it and decided to join. When I entered the room, there were about 6 people in there, all talking very softly. One man brought a VR Kix - a smartphone operated VR Headset

We all introduced ourselves and I found quickly that everyone in the room came from very different backgrounds. Many were experienced with unity and game design, while others were videographers and designers. Some people were just head honchos at companies looking for possible investment opportunities.
